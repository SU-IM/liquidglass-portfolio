                <p>I primarily work with Final Cut Pro on a Mac and shoot with a DJI Pocket 3 or an iPhone 16. Rather than using flashy effects, I prefer a more streamlined editing style, using cuts and subtitles.</p>  
                    
                <p>It's from my visit to Disneyland in Anaheim. Although I don't have many subscribers, I occasionally upload travel videos.</p>

                <h2>Media Artwork</h2>
                <img src="images/Will-o'-the-wisp.gif" alt="">
                <p>This is part of three different nature-related media art pieces I had to showcase last year. All code was written in p5.js (JavaScript).</p>
                <p>Among the will-o'-the-wisps, the spirits from the movie Frozen 2 came to mind. I tried to visualise them flying through the forest. The object freely floats when there is no movement of the mouse. But when we move the mouse on the screen, it chases the pointer.</p> 
                <p>Currently uploaded as a GIF, so you can't interact with them directly. Basically, you can change the red and blue with the numbers 1 and 2, and change the dot size of the spirit by pressing - and +.</p>
